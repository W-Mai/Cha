## [Unreleased]

## [1.13.1] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- **`abstraction_leak_surgery` detector** — files that co-change in git history **and** share a third-party type in their function signatures. Upgrade of the classic `shotgun_surgery`: instead of "these files always change together" (agnostic of why), this pinpoints "these files always change together *because* they all depend on the same external type" — the shared external type is the concrete abstraction leak driving the co-change cascade. Severity `Hint`.
  - Inputs: git co-change counts (`git log --name-only -N`, threshold ≥ 5 commits in last 100) × per-file `TypeOrigin::External` sets derived from parameter / return types. Workspace-sibling crates auto-whitelisted (same mechanism `cross_boundary_chain` / `leaky_public_signature` use), so `cha_core`-internal dependencies between `cha-parser` / `cha-cli` don't fire.
  - Cha self-baseline: 10 genuine findings, all pointing at the 5 language parsers sharing `tree_sitter::Node` — exactly the abstraction leak the detector is designed to find (tree-sitter upgrades ripple across every parser file). lvgl `src/`: 0 (C project, no External origins).

## [1.13.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- **`primitive_representation` detector** (roadmap S8.2). Flags function parameters whose **name** carries a domain concept (`user_id`, `email`, `status_code`, `api_url`, `password`, `language`, …) but whose **type** is a raw scalar primitive (`String`, `i32`, `bool`, `char`, …). Signals an opportunity to introduce a newtype / value object to preserve the invariant. Per-parameter detection groups all offending params of one function into a single hint. Complements the existing `primitive_obsession` (which looks at per-function ratio): this fires on even a single param when it's clearly a business concept.
  - Business-token and noise-token vocabularies are deliberately narrow to keep signal-to-noise high. Substring matches are ruled out (tokens must be standalone words — `widget_identifier` does not trigger on `id`).
  - Parameters already typed with project-local newtypes (e.g. `id: UserId` where `UserId` is `TypeOrigin::Local`) are skipped — the author already did the right thing.
  - Container types (`Path`, `PathBuf`, `Vec`, `Arc`, `Box`, `HashMap`, …) are treated as domain-carrying and excluded; wrapping `path: &Path` in a newtype would destroy the abstraction.
  - Only runs on `is_exported` functions — private helpers are noise for a design signal aimed at public API hygiene.
  - Cha self-analyze: 14 findings (all genuine — `rel_path`/`env_hash`/`language`/`key`/`hash` as raw types). lvgl `src/` baseline: 53 findings (TTF `platformID/encodingID/languageID/nameID: int`, file-explorer `path/dir: char` pointers, …).
- **`stringly_typed_dispatch` detector** (roadmap S8.8). Flags functions whose `switch`/`match` body dispatches on ≥ 3 **string** or ≥ 3 **integer** literal arms — classic "the arm values should have been an enum" smell. Char-literal arms (C tokenisers) skipped. Enum-variant / structural-pattern arms classify as `Other` and never contribute to the threshold, so `match event { Event::Click => …, Event::Scroll => …, _ => … }` stays quiet while `match s { "click" => …, "scroll" => …, "submit" => … }` fires. Severity `Hint`. Complements S8.2 `primitive_representation` (signature side) with the body-side dispatch signal.
  - New `cha_core::ArmValue` enum (`Str / Int / Char / Other`) + `FunctionInfo.switch_arm_values` + `FunctionSymbol.switch_arm_values`. Populated by every parser via a new shared `cha-parser/src/switch_arms.rs` helper — language-specific arm-node kinds funnel through one classifier.
  - Cha self-baseline: 20 findings (all node-kind dispatchers in the 6 language parsers — valid detections, users can add `// cha:ignore stringly_typed_dispatch` if the dispatch shape is forced by tree-sitter). lvgl `src/` baseline: 23 findings (PNG/JPEG/QR error-code dispatchers, color-format size tables, TTF bytecode interpreter).
- **`cross_boundary_chain` detector** (roadmap S8.U4). Flags functions where `chain_depth ≥ 3` **and** the chain's root parameter is externally-typed (`TypeOrigin::External(crate)`) — the function is reaching into a third-party library's internal field layout, not just over-chaining local data. Companion to the existing `message_chain` (which fires on depth regardless of source): `cross_boundary_chain` is narrower but a stronger abstraction-leak signal. Severity `Hint`.
  - Workspace crates are auto-whitelisted (same mechanism `leaky_public_signature` uses), so sibling `cha_core::Finding` traversals inside this repo don't fire. Cha self-baseline: 4 findings, all genuine `tree_sitter::Node` traversals in `cha-parser`. lvgl `src/` baseline: 0 (C project, few `External` origins by design).
  - Zero parser changes — reuses `chain_depth`, `parameter_types` (with origin), `parameter_names`, `external_refs`. Pure post-pass on `ProjectIndex`.
- **`FunctionInfo.parameter_names` + `FunctionSymbol.parameter_names`** (`cha-core`). Parallel to `parameter_types`: identifier names in declaration order. All six parsers (Rust / TS / Python / Go / C / C++) extract these; `self` / C++ `this` positions skipped to stay length-aligned with `parameter_types`. Enables name-semantic analyses like `primitive_representation`, future LSP hover with full signatures, future `cha summary`.
- New helpers `cha_parser::rust_imports::rust_param_names` and `cha_parser::cpp::c_param_name` extract identifier names from their language's declarator chains; reused across all C/C++ function-definition sites.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **`SymbolIndex` — structural view of a file, cached separately from `SourceModel`.** New type in `cha-core::model` carrying the fields consumers like `cha deps`, LSP workspace-symbols, and future `cha summary` all share — class/function names + signatures + positions + `type_aliases` — without per-function-body data (complexity, body hash, TypeRef origin, cognitive, chain depth etc. stay in `SourceModel`).
  - `ProjectCache::{get,put}_symbols` store to `symbols/{chash}.bin`, mirrored independently of `parse/{chash}.bin`. Same `env_hash` mechanism invalidates both on parser code changes.
  - `cached_symbols(path)` is a new warm fast path that skips `SourceModel` deserialisation entirely — `symbols/{chash}.bin` is roughly 10% the size of `parse/{chash}.bin`.
  - `cached_parse` now populates both caches on every fresh parse, so the two views are always in lockstep.
  - `lvgl src/` warm benchmarks (379 files): `deps --type imports` 1.28s → 38ms (34×), `--type classes` 1.30s → 56ms (23×), `--type calls` 1.30s → 48ms (27×). Edge counts unchanged vs. pre-migration (1351/142/8109).
  - `cha-cli/src/c_oop_enrich` grows a `enrich_c_oop_symbols` / `attribute_methods_by_name_from_symbols` pair alongside the existing `SourceModel` functions. Shared `attribute_one_raw` keeps attribution rules single-sourced; build-index / write-back are deliberate parallel code paths because the two storage types have to stay independent.
  - `cha-cli/src/parse_cache.rs` (new module) hosts both `cached_parse` and `cached_symbols`.
- **C++ parser now handles `ClassName::method()` out-of-class definitions, namespaces, and templates.** Three gaps in the previous CppParser have been closed:
  - `void Foo::bar() {...}` (and `::global()`, `A::B::c()`, destructors `Foo::~Foo()`, operators `Foo::operator+()`) was silently dropped — `find_func_name_node` only accepted bare `identifier` declarators. It now also unwraps `qualified_identifier`, `destructor_name`, and `operator_name`.
  - Out-of-class method definitions now attribute to their owning same-file class: `void Foo::bar()` bumps `ClassInfo::method_count` on `Foo` and flips `has_behavior`. Cross-file attribution still runs through `cha-cli::c_oop_enrich`.
  - `namespace_definition`, `linkage_specification` (`extern "C" { ... }`), and `template_declaration` are now explicitly matched in the top-level dispatch (previously fell through to the generic recursion arm) — same observable behaviour, but the nesting constructs are now a stable hook rather than an accidental default-case artefact.
  - C++-specific declarator helpers moved to a new `cha-parser/src/cpp.rs` so `c_lang.rs` stays below the `large_file` gate.
- **`SourceModel.type_aliases` now populated for Rust, TypeScript, Python, and Go** (previously all four returned empty `vec![]` with parser-side TODOs). Each parser recognises its language's alias form and records `(alias, rhs)` pairs: Rust `type X = Y;` / `pub type X<T> = Y;`, TypeScript `type X = Y;` / `export type X<T> = Y;`, Python 3.12+ `type X = Y` and pre-3.12 `X: TypeAlias = Y`, Go `type X = Y` (only the true alias form — `type X Y` defined types are excluded). Plain Python `X = Y` assignments remain unclassified (too ambiguous). Shared extraction lives in a new `cha-parser/src/type_aliases.rs` module so per-language files stay below the `large_file` gate.

### Changed
- **`boundary_leak` detector migrated to `ProjectIndex`.** The three smells it emits (`abstraction_boundary_leak`, `return_type_leak`, `test_only_type_in_production`) previously parsed the whole project a second time — the codebase noted a "cached model occasionally drops typedef aliases" concern with root cause TBD. v1.11.0's binary-mtime cache keying removed the suspected root cause, and a new `cache::tests::cache_roundtrip_preserves_type_aliases` unit test makes the invariant a testable one. `boundary_leak::detect` now takes `&ProjectIndex` and shares the same parse pass as `anemic_domain_model`, `typed_intimacy`, `module_envy`, and friends. Verified against lvgl's `src/` tree: 155 findings before = 155 findings after (`abstraction_boundary_leak: 154, return_type_leak: 1`). Completes roadmap S8.infra.4.

### Fixed
- **C++: template specialisation methods attribute to the right class.** `template<> void Foo<int>::bar()` used to drop on the floor because the qualifier `Foo<int>` (a `template_type` node) didn't match the stored class name `Foo`. `attach_to_class` now strips trailing `<...>` template arguments before matching, so out-of-class specialisations attribute correctly. Same stripping applies to any declaration whose declarator surfaces `Foo<...>` as the owning scope.
- **C++: real inheritance (`class Derived : public Base`) now recognised.** `extract_class` consults the `base_class_clause` child and pulls the first `type_identifier` (or `template_type`'s underlying name) as `parent_name`. Falls back to the first-field heuristic only when no base clause is present, so legacy C struct-embedding cases still work. Also fixes the class-name extraction for templated classes so `template<typename T> class Foo {...}` stores `"Foo"` instead of `"Foo<T>"`.
- **C++: reference-return methods no longer vanish.** `const int& Foo::get()` and similar `reference_declarator`-wrapped definitions used to be silently dropped because tree-sitter-cpp's `reference_declarator` has no `declarator` field — the declarator walker returned `None`. Both `find_func_name_node` (c_lang) and `descend_to_qualified_identifier` (cpp) now fall back to the first named child when the field is absent. Same fix path covers reference-return + qualified (`const T& Foo::bar()`) so class attribution still works. 6 additional regression tests (reference/pointer return types, multi-method attribution, constructor, `extern "C"`, const member) added in `cha-parser/tests/cpp_enhancements.rs` (14 total).

## [1.11.1] - 2026-04-27

### Changed
- Internal: split git-backed post-analysis passes (`unstable_dependency`, `bus_factor`, `low_test_ratio`) out of `cha-cli/src/analyze.rs` into a new `cha-cli/src/git_metrics` module. No behaviour change; `analyze.rs` drops below the 850-line `large_file` threshold that `cargo xtask analyze` gates on. `collect_top_level` in the C parser also picks up `// cha:ignore high_complexity` alongside the existing cognitive-complexity ignore after the `declaration` arm added one branch.

Note: 1.11.0 was tagged in the repo but the CI self-analyze gate failed on the above source-dir warnings so crates.io was never updated. 1.11.1 is the first shipped release of the 1.11 line.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Cache invalidation now tracks the cha binary**, not `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`. `env_hash` folds in `std::env::current_exe()`'s mtime, so any new binary — developer rebuild after editing parser code, or end-user upgrade to a new release — invalidates stale cached `SourceModel` entries. The previous version-based key allowed parser behaviour changes shipped without a `cargo xtask bump` to silently serve wrong cached data (which is what hid the header-declaration parser fix from users with existing `.cha/cache`). Falls back to `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` when `current_exe()` fails (unusual — sandboxed runners).
- C/C++ parser now extracts function declarations from header files (`void foo(int);` — no body). Previously the parser only recognised `function_definition` nodes at the top level, silently dropping every prototype in a `.h` file. This broke `cha deps --type classes --detail` on C projects (every widget method displayed as private), `leaky_public_signature` (blind to the real public API), and the `c_oop_enrich::tighten_exports` pass (demoted public `.c` implementations whose `.h` declaration didn't parse). Variadic + attribute-macro signatures like `foo(..., ...) LV_FORMAT_ATTRIBUTE(4, 5)` remain an edge case because tree-sitter-c errors on the macro. **Existing `.cha/cache/` entries are stale after this fix and need to be deleted manually** — the cache key hashes `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`, not parser behaviour.

### Changed
- C OOP attribution is now longest-prefix + inheritance-aware: given `struct derived_t { base_t obj; ... }` (first-field embedded base), `derived_do(base_t *obj)` attributes to `derived_t` rather than the base, because the function name's longest matching prefix points at the specific subclass and `derived_t`'s ancestor chain includes `base_t`. Eliminates the previous over-attribution where short prefixes caused base classes to absorb methods that morally belong to subclasses. Large C codebases see base classes drop hundreds of borrowed methods; subclasses now correctly show their own methods in `cha deps --type classes --detail` UML.
- `cha deps --type classes --detail` now uses the project-wide C OOP attribution from `c_oop_enrich` to fill methods on C/C++ UML output. Previously relied on a same-directory heuristic that missed cross-module methods; now picks up methods on shared metaclasses regardless of which file they live in. Also runs enrich on `parse_all_models` so C models read by `deps` see the corrected `method_count` / `has_behavior` / `is_exported`.
- **C OOP cross-file method attribution**: new `cha-cli/src/c_oop_enrich` module runs inside `ProjectIndex::parse` to rewrite `ClassInfo.method_count` / `has_behavior` and tighten `FunctionInfo.is_exported` for C / C++ projects. Uses tokenisation (snake_case, PascalCase, camelCase, acronyms) + typedef alias following to attribute free functions to structs via the universal `foo_t` + `foo_xxx(foo_t *self)` convention. Forward declarations and full definitions of the same struct share attribution. Third-party types declared only in `.c` files (no `.h` declaration) get demoted from exported to internal. Only affects post-analysis index-backed detectors (`anemic_domain_model`, `leaky_public_signature`, etc.); per-file Plugin detectors (`lazy_class`, `data_class`) still see the unenriched model and remain disabled in the C profile.
- Replaces the previous same-file `associate_methods` in `cha-parser::c_lang` (deleted) and the same-directory `c_oop_filter` post-hoc filter in `cha-cli` (deleted) with a single project-wide enrichment pass.

### Added
- `cha analyze --focus <category>` — comma-separated filter keeping only findings whose `SmellCategory` matches one of the listed values (`bloaters`, `oo_abusers`, `change_preventers`, `dispensables`, `couplers`, `security`). Unknown categories warn on stderr instead of crashing. Lets users narrow a noisy analyze run to a single architectural concern.
- `Finding.risk_score: Option<f64>` — composite priority (severity × overshoot × hotspot factor) populated by `prioritize_findings` after analysis. Surfaces *why* a finding ranks where it does in reporter output and JSON/SARIF. Schema regenerated.
- **`leaky_public_signature`** — flags an exported function whose parameters or return type mention a third-party crate's type. Workspace-internal crates (derived from project file paths) and Rust's built-in modules (`std`, `core`, `alloc`, `proc_macro`, …) are filtered out so intra-workspace and prelude types don't fire. Hint severity.
- **`cross_layer_import`** — post-analysis pass that automatically infers project layers from the import graph (Martin's instability) and flags imports crossing boundaries upward. No configuration required; defers to the existing `layer_violation` plugin when the user has written an explicit `[plugins.layer_violation]` config. Warning severity (architectural violation).

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **`god_config`** — flags a `Config`/`Settings`/`Options`/`Context`/`Env`/`AppState`/`Store`-shaped type (exact name or `*Config`/`*Settings`/`*Options` suffix) passed as a parameter to ≥ 10 distinct functions spanning ≥ 3 files. Signals ambient configuration leaking everywhere instead of each caller taking only the fields it actually needs. Hint severity.
- **`circular_abstraction`** — flags two files whose functions call each other's functions in both directions (≥ 2 calls each way). Catches behaviour-level mutual dependency that import-graph cycle detection misses when the callees are re-exported or wrapped. Complements `typed_intimacy` (type flow) with call flow. Hint severity.
- **`parameter_position_inconsistency`** — flags functions where a domain type appears at a different parameter position than the project-wide majority. Requires ≥ 3 usages of the same type across functions and disagreement on position; primitives, unresolved-origin types, mutable-ref out-params (`&mut Vec<_>`), and `self` receivers are skipped. Hint severity.

### Changed
- Internal: `cha-cli/src/project_index.rs` — shared `ProjectIndex` owns parsed models plus derived maps (function_home, class_home, project_type_names, function_by_name). `anemic_domain_model`, `typed_intimacy`, `module_envy`, and `parameter_position_inconsistency` build the index once per analyze call instead of each rebuilding their own copies. No behaviour change; behaviourally identical on self-analyze. Boundary_leak still parses fresh because of a stale-typedef cache bug not yet rooted out.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **`module_envy`** — flags a function that makes ≥ 3 calls into another file in the project while making ≤ half as many calls within its own file. The function is a "resident" of the wrong module — its body does work that belongs in the envied module. Suppresses test → `common.rs` pairs and calls to conventional helper filenames (`utils`, `helpers`, `shared`, `prelude`, …) where cross-file dependency is idiomatic, not misplaced. Hint severity.
- **`typed_intimacy`** — flags file pairs whose function signatures exchange each other's declared types in both directions. Stronger signal than import-level `inappropriate_intimacy`: the pair literally accepts/returns types defined in each other, indicating they're functionally fused at the type boundary. Emits one finding per side of the pair, listing the shared type names. Hint severity.
- **`async_callback_leak`** — flags a function signature that exposes a raw concurrency primitive (`JoinHandle`, `Future`, `Task`, `Sender`, `Receiver`, `Promise`, `Awaitable`, `Coroutine`, `CancelFunc`, …) in its return type or parameters. Skips launcher-shaped names (`spawn_*`, `launch_*`, `start_*`) where exposing the handle is the function's whole purpose. Hint severity.
- **`anemic_domain_model`** — flags a class that is pure data (≥ 2 fields, no behavior) paired with one or more external service-shaped functions (filename ends in `service`/`manager`/`handler`/`helper`/`util`, or function name starts with a service verb prefix like `process_`/`validate_`/`calculate_`) that take the class as a first parameter. Promotes a `data_class` hint into an architectural finding when there's evidence the paired service owns behavior that should live on the class itself. Hint severity.
- **`test_only_type_in_production`** — warns when production code references a class/struct declared only in test files (mocks, stubs, fixtures). Surfaces test scaffolding bleeding into shipping code. Warning severity.
- **`return_type_leak`** post-analysis finding — dual of `abstraction_boundary_leak`. Detects when a dispatcher fans out to ≥ 3 sibling handlers whose return types are all the same non-local type, surfacing missing Anti-Corruption Layer on the way *out*. lvgl scan identifies thorvg's `TVG_API` leaking through dispatcher boundaries.
- `FunctionInfo.return_type: Option<TypeRef>` — parsers extract the declared return type and resolve its origin through the same imports/type-registry pipeline as parameters. WIT schema grows an optional `return-type` field.
- Container-expression primitive fallback: PEP 585 `dict[K, V]` / `list[T]` / `tuple[...]` resolve to Primitive instead of Unknown, eliminating false positives on Python handlers that return built-in container types.

### Changed
- WIT `function-info` record gains `return-type: option<type-ref>` — **breaking for WASM plugins**, rebuild against the new SDK.
- `cha-cli/src/analyze.rs` — extracted C OOP false-positive filter to `c_oop_filter.rs` and split `run_post_analysis` into git-based and signature-based helpers to keep the orchestrator lean as more post-analysis passes land.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **`abstraction_boundary_leak`** post-analysis finding — detects dispatcher functions that fan out to ≥ 3 sibling callbacks which all share the same non-local type in corresponding parameter positions. Flagged as a missing Anti-Corruption Layer. lvgl scan shows 11/13 true-positive rate identifying GLAD/SDL/STB/Win32 leaks.
- `FunctionInfo.parameter_types` now carries `TypeRef { name, raw, origin }` where `origin` is `Local | External(module) | Primitive | Unknown`. Each parser resolves origins from file imports: Rust `use_declaration`, TS `import_statement`, Python `import` / `from`, Go `import_spec` with `go.mod` module root lookup, C/C++ primitive seeding.
- Parser normalisation helpers in `cha-parser/src/type_ref.rs` unwrap `&'a mut Vec<Option<T>>`, `[]T`, `List[T]`, `pkg.Type` etc. down to the innermost identifier for import lookup.
- Universal-primitive fallback in resolve (String, PathBuf, HashMap, int, boolean, etc.) so common prelude types without explicit imports don't trip the detector.
- **`unwrap_abuse`** now emits one finding per `.unwrap()` / `.expect(` call site (was: single finding at function name). IDE underlines each call directly.
- **`switch_statement`** now points at the `switch` / `match` keyword inside the function body (was: function name).
- **`message_chain`** now points at the `a.b.c.d` chain expression itself (was: function name). Heuristic text scan, falls back to function name when the chain can't be textually located.

### Changed
- `FunctionInfo.parameter_types` type changed from `Vec<String>` to `Vec<TypeRef>` — **breaking change for WASM plugins and cached SourceModels**. WIT schema adds `type-ref` record and `type-origin` variant. Rebuilding against the new SDK picks up generated types automatically.
- Parsers no longer sort `parameter_types` — declaration order is preserved, fixing latent `.first()`-based C OOP heuristics that silently depended on alphabetical ordering. `data_clumps` plugin now sorts its own key locally.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- `cargo xtask release` — `wait_for_workflow` now filters runs by the commit SHA (for ci.yml) and the tag branch (for release.yml), instead of taking the latest run unconditionally. Previously a stale success on an unrelated commit would cause the release flow to skip waiting and publish to crates.io while the new CI was still queued; a stale failure would abort a release that would otherwise pass.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- `cha analyze --top N` flag — show only the N most severe findings (terminal format), complements `--all`
- **Smell-level disable**: `disabled_smells = ["smell_name"]` in `.cha.toml` (global) or under `[languages.<lang>]` (language-scoped). Finer-grained than disabling a whole plugin when it produces multiple smells
- `Plugin::smells()` — plugins declare which `smell_name` values they can produce. Exposed as a WIT export for WASM plugins
- `cha plugin list` now shows each plugin's declared smells
- `cha preset show <lang>` now shows effective disabled smells
- SDK helper `cha_plugin_sdk::is_smell_disabled!(&input.options, "smell_name")` — WASM plugins can skip disabled work proactively

### Changed
- C/C++ builtin profile: `builder_pattern`, `null_object_pattern`, `strategy_pattern`, `data_clumps` are now properly disabled via smell-level config (previously tried — and failed — to disable them by plugin name)
- WIT `analyzer` world gains `smells: func() -> list<string>` export — **breaking change for WASM plugins** (recompile to pick up default impl)

### Fixed
- lvgl-scale improvement: analyze now emits ~1200 fewer false positives because smell-level disables actually take effect

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- `Location` now has `start_col`/`end_col` fields — all findings precise to column level
- `FunctionInfo`/`ClassInfo` have `name_col`/`name_end_col` — parser records identifier position
- `ImportInfo` has `col` — import statement column position
- Terminal output shows `file:line:col` when column info available
- SARIF output fills `startColumn`/`endColumn` (1-based per spec)
- LSP diagnostics use precise column range

### Changed
- All 37 builtin plugins now point findings at the function/class name, not the entire body
- Line-scanning plugins (unsafe_api, hardcoded_secret, todo_tracker, error_handling) report exact column
- WIT records gain column fields — `location.start-col`/`end-col`, `function-info.name-col`/`name-end-col`, `class-info.name-col`/`name-end-col`, `import-info.col` — **breaking change for WASM plugins**

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- VS Code `cha.disabledPlugins` setting — suppress specific findings via `initializationOptions`
- Hover report card shows actual plugin findings with severity icons
- Coupling/hub_like findings mark import line range precisely

### Changed
- **LSP architecture**: all handlers read from ProjectCache — no per-handler plugin execution
- LSP uses pull-only diagnostics (`textDocument/diagnostic`), removed push duplicates
- CodeLens shows findings count + severity instead of raw parse metrics
- Inlay Hints show findings summary (⚠N or ✓)
- File-level findings (large_file, shotgun_surgery, etc.) mark only line 1

### Fixed
- Duplicate diagnostics (push + pull) in VS Code
- `disabledPlugins` now filters by finding name, not plugin name
- LSP shares `.cha/cache/` with CLI via ProjectCache

## [1.4.2] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- VS Code: auto-detect outdated cha binary — prompt update when version mismatches extension
- VS Code: debug logs in ensureBinary for diagnostics
- VS Code e2e: real VS Code test on 3 platforms (ubuntu/macos/windows) with sinon stub for user Download click

### Fixed
- SDK macros: include build.rs in package
- VS Code: Windows download (.zip + PowerShell + .exe)
- VS Code: exclude test files from .vsix via .vscodeignore
- CI: vscode e2e set continue-on-error for network flakiness

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- VS Code extension CI: `vsce package` validation + download e2e test on GitHub Actions
- Download e2e test imports actual extension code (shared `download.ts` module)

### Fixed

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **LSP Document Symbols**: outline view with ⚠ markers based on actual findings severity
- **LSP**: Document Symbols ⚠ markers now respect `.cha.toml` thresholds (no hardcoded values)

### Changed

- Include tests in cha-core crate package (eliminates publish warnings)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **LSP CodeLens**: show complexity, cognitive, lines, params above every function/class
- **LSP Hover**: detailed quality report card on hover (markdown table)
- **LSP Inlay Hints**: inline cx/cog/lines annotations at end of function definitions

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- Cache v2: bincode serialization + per-file parse cache + mtime fast-path
- L1 in-memory parse cache — zero disk I/O for repeated access within same process
- Cached imports in meta for instant `unstable_dependency` analysis
- `ProjectCache` with L1/L2 architecture shared across analyze/layers/deps/calibrate

### Changed
